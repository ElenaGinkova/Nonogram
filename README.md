# Nonogram
course project

Nonograms (or griddlers, paint by numbers, picross, hanjie, or a million other names) are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture.

It's a popular type of puzzle, and most platforms have several apps that let users solve nonograms.
